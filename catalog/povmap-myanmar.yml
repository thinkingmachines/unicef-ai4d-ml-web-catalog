name: 'Relative Wealth Model for Myanmar'
description: >
  This is an sklearn Random Forest (RF) regressor model for predicting relative wealth for Myanmar.
  Through a post-training binning process, the model also predicts a quintile-grouped relative wealth category ('A' to 'E') 
  It is a single-country model trained on open datasets from Earth Observation Group (EOG) nightlights data, Open Streetmap (OSM) Points of Interest (POI) data, Ookla internet speed data
  as well as Domestic and Health Survey (DHS) data from USAID. 
  It was built as part of the UNICEF AI4D Relative Wealth Project which aims to develop open datasets and machine learning (ML) models for relative wealth estimation across nine countries 
  in Southeast Asia (SEA).
