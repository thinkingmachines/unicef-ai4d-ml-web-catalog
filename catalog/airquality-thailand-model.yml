name: 'Air Quality Model for Thailand'
description: >
  This project explored PM2.5 estimation using Machine Learning models in Thailand. Air pollution is a pressing health concern worldwide, and thus, its monitoring is important for epidemological studies and informing public policy.
  However, ground sensors (whether reference grade or low-cost) are sparse. For example, in Mueang Chiang Mai, there are only a few air quality sensors based on OpenAQ data.
  Using Machine Learning models to predict PM2.5 levels based on area predictors is a potential way to augment these ground stations, and allows us to monitor air quality even in areas without them.

      Table generated from OpenAQ PM2.5 values.This file also contains the same columns as the air4thai one, but with the additional sensor_type column. This indicated which type of sensor was used to measure PM2.5 value in each station per day.
      This is the latest, best dataset we have for ML modelling. The other datasets were preserved for replicating the experiments.

      Table patched from the sub-regression model experiment.
      Missing MAIAC AOD values were predicted using a model trained using CAM AOD data. 
      These predictions were appended to the existing AOD data used for training the AOD model. 
      This patched table was then used to predict PM 2.5 values
